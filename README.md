# Mashu Components 
***
### A bunch of React components created using `styled-components` 
***
#### Getting Started
To start in development, run `yarn run storybook`. <br>
Navigate to localhost:9009 if it didn't automatically open. <br>
You shouldn't need to `npm install` or `yarn install` because `yarn.lock` is committed. 
***
#### File structure 
You'll work in `./src`. <br>
Inside there `./src/packages` contain the actual components we're creating
and through `./src/stories` we put them on the window.
***
#### Contributing
NEVER commit to master directly. <br> 
Make a branch and open up a PR, Mashu must approve all PRs. <br>
***
##### Up and coming to the repo:
the use of DefaultProps to set requiredProps. <br>
the use of knobs and add-ons toÂ test UI in storybook. <br>
tests for all components.
add Angular and Vue components.
separate components based on framework used.
